# i3-json

The i3 JSON Toolkit is used to parse and generate arbitrary JSON data in LabVIEW. The toolkit allows the user to manipulate JSON data following the specification described at json.org and in RFC 4627.

An API interface consisting of a set of low-level and fast VIs are provided for the development of applications as well as a set of high-level and slow VIs to enable rapid prototyping. Utilities for visualizing JSON data in LabVIEW Trees are made available for user interaction.
